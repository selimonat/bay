questions:


suggestion for future

randomize more -
if possible don’t cut out recordings between conditioning to test…
never stop it before 15 seconds after the last trial….
S1_04 has a strange last event record
record pure responses to UCSs
one can record 2, 3 times more trials
people rate during interest SCR signal interval...


to do:
re-do the ledalab analysis with [0 18] second temporal window
make the same analysis for the second session
variance
